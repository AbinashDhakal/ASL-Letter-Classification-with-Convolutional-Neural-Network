# ASL-Letter-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters. The dataset consists of images representing the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The model is trained to predict the correct letter based on the input image.
